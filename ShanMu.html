    <h3>
        Even after being here for years, I still feel like I’m pretending to be someone else when I speak English.
        <br><br>

        English has an urge to explain everything without leaving room for ambiguity. Chinese, on the other hand, tends
        to hide meaning within words. Chinese writers enjoy playing word games with their readers. For example, in
        <i>Journey to the West</i>, the main character is Wukong, the Monkey King. But if you look at the name character
        by
        character, “Wu” means <i>try to understand</i> and “Kong” means <i>emptiness</i> (a concept in Daoism). Later, I
        come to
        realize that Wukong’s journey is actually a journey to “wu kong” — to understand emptiness. A similar wordplay
        appears in <i>Dream of the Red Chamber</i>, whose main character is named Baoyu (宝玉), meaning “precious jade.”
        At
        birth, Baoyu is found with a piece of magical jade in his mouth—this jade becomes both a literal object and a
        symbolic anchor of the story. The name "Baoyu" hides layered meanings: on one level, it signals his unique and
        privileged status; on another, it foreshadows his entrapment in material desire and illusion. Just as Wukong
        must transcend his name to achieve enlightenment, Baoyu must lose his jade—his “preciousness”—to awaken from the
        grand illusion of worldly life. Even the novel’s alternate title, The Story of the Stone, hints at this: the
        stone or jade is both central and deceptive, a metaphor for something that seems solid but is ultimately empty.

        <br><br>
        These stories, when read for the first time, seem like fantastical tales—one about retrieving sacred texts from
        the West, another a record of the lavish Grand View Garden. But upon rereading, or only after a long time, you
        slowly begin to grasp the truths that are never directly stated. I love these kinds of stories. They exist in
        English translations too—take <i>The Little Prince</i>, for instance. It uses fairy tale-like language to
        express
        universal truths. But the language it uses is more direct.
        <br><br>
        When I first came to the U.S., around the age of twenty, I found myself mirroring the world around
        me—expressions, glances, even the flicker of someone’s hand. Perhaps it was echopraxia, or perhaps just a quiet
        hunger to belong. With the wide-eyed curiosity of a child, I tried to catch meaning in the air, tracing sound
        with gesture, shadowing language I did not yet know. Communicating with my roommate required drawings, gestures,
        and extremely basic vocabulary. I would laugh at jokes I didn’t even understand, avoid explaining things to
        escape the struggle of gesturing wildly, nod at things I didn’t comprehend, and ask a thousand questions, a
        thousand times. In those moments, I would suddenly feel detached, feeling extremely unfamiliar with the
        English-speaking version of myself. Who are you? And who am I?
        <br><br>
        Before this multilingual experience, I believed that emotions and sensitivity were innate and universally
        shared. But I later realized this wasn’t entirely true.

        <br><br>
        There is no equivalent of the word “缘分” (<i>yuanfen</i>) in English. It’s often translated as “fate,” but “fate”
        is a
        different concept. I can’t quite explain to you the subtle feeling of yuanfen. Every event and encounter in your
        life might be because of yuanfen. It sounds like fate, but Chinese people believe in yuan, not in ming (fate).
        In Chinese culture, fate is something that can be challenged and changed—even an ordinary person can defy the
        heavens and change their destiny. But <i>yuanfen</i> is predestined.


        <br><br>
        Just like I may never understand why January isn’t simply called “the first month,” or why “break a leg” became
        a form of well-wishing—it still sounds like a curse to me, no matter what.

        <br><br>
        Language fails me—not just in translation, but in becoming a kind of cultural shackle. Hidden within language
        are layers of culture and subconscious suggestion. To better translate English’s gender distinctions of “he,”
        “she,” and “it,” Chinese in the early 20th century introduced the characters 他 (he), 她 (she), and 它 (it). Before
        that, Chinese didn’t mark gender in pronouns—“he” and “she” were both written as 他 and understood through
        context. People were described by their roles, relationships, or actions rather than by gendered categories. The
        language allowed for fluidity, a kind of ambiguity that reflected a different way of seeing identity.
        <br><br>
        In trying to accommodate English, Chinese adopted this gendered system. But this shift also imported a way of
        thinking: one that requires categorizing people by gender even when it's irrelevant. Similarly, in the late 19th
        century, phrases like “lose face” and “save face” entered English, borrowed from Chinese face culture.
        <br><br>
        These small borrowings add up, shaping how we think and speak. And now, I find myself caught in a crevice
        between English and Chinese. I want so much to describe how I feel, and yet, once again, language fails me. In
        English, I stumble over rigid pronouns and categorical grammar. In Chinese, I grieve the subtle forms of
        expression that are being lost—ways of describing people without locking them into gendered roles. Language
        fails me not only in its structure, but in how it frames the self.
        <br><br>
        In 2018, I wrote in my notes:
        <br><br>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
            Maybe, just maybe, from the moment we’re born, <br></p>
            <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
            we are stripped of the right to think freely. <br></p>
            <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
            Eternal, unchanging ideas—they don’t exist.<br></p>
            <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
            Beliefs that once seemed so normal and firm—<br></p>
            <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
            Now, in another culture, I find they were never truly there.<br></p>
            <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
            Maybe everything is just... nothingness.<br></p>
            <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
            And what of this so-called self, the individual—does that even exist?<br>
        </p>
        <span class="hover-image" data-img="img/asset.jpg"><img src="img/sight.png" width="20px"></span>
        <br><br>
        Eastern philosophy says: all things are empty. I don’t know whether I’ve become enlightened or lost in delusion.
        It reminds me of Dream of the Red Chamber—a grand dream, all things returning to emptiness. It feels a bit
        melancholic. It makes me think of Journey to the West—maybe going through this untranslatable, multilingual
        journey is a kind of spiritual trial that brings true awareness of self. And I also think of The Little
        Prince—perhaps if I feel with my heart, I can break through the limits of language.
        <br><br>
        Maybe when language fails me, all things return to emptiness—not as a loss, but as a release.
        <br><br>
        And in that release, a self untouched by cultural framing, by grammar and gender, might finally begin to take
        shape.
        <br><br>

            who explores live simulation, digital storytelling, artificial intelligence, and the methodology of
            programming languages. Her practice explores the complexity of emerging technology and computation as an
            alternative narrative container. Her work has been exhibited internationally at venues such as Black Brick
            Project (NYC, US), Instinc (Singapore), Rubicon (Australia), ICAVCU (Richmond, VA), and others. She is
            pursuing an MFA in Kinetic Imaging from Virginia Commonwealth University School of Arts and holds a BS in
            computer science with minors in Mathematics and Arts from the University of Delaware. She taught Creative
            Code & Electronics at VCUarts Kinetic Imaging.
